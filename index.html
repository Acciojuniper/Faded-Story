          <p>It's been two years since the outbreak. People all over the world are suffering from the epidemic. People are displaced, not allowed to reunite with their families and have lost those closest to them forever. It's 2022, and many places are no longer barred from traveling because of COVID-19.

I wanted to honor those long-distance lovers with this video</p>

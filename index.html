          <p>It's been two years since the covid outbreak. People all over the world are suffering from the epidemic. People are displaced, not allowed to reunite with their families and even have lost those closest to them forever. It's 2022, many places are no longer barred from traveling. But on April the first, one place, one of the world's financial centres, has suddenly become the loneliest city because of the covid lockdown. Many people are unable to return to the city to be with their families. This is a game in memory of those long-distance lovers during Shanghai lockdown.</p>
